# Meridian

Autonomous Meteora DLMM liquidity management agent for Solana.

Meridian screens pools, deploys capital, manages open positions, records lessons, and can evolve both thresholds and prompt behavior over time. It is designed to run continuously with a web dashboard, REPL, and optional Telegram control surface.

## What It Runs

Meridian has three LLM-facing agent roles:

| Agent | Purpose | Typical schedule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SCREENER` | Finds candidates, studies pools, decides whether to deploy | every `screeningIntervalMin` |
| `MANAGER` | Reviews live positions, claims fees, closes or holds | every `managementIntervalMin` |
| `GENERAL` | Chat and command handling | on demand |

There is also an autoresearch subsystem that tests prompt changes after real closes and keeps or reverts them based on later performance.

## LLM Providers

Meridian supports five provider modes. Set via `LLM_PROVIDER` in `.env` or `llmProvider` in `user-config.json`:

| Provider | How it works | Auth | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | Runs model turns through `claude -p` (Claude Code CLI) | OAuth login (`claude` CLI) | Uses your Claude Pro/Max subscription |
| `codex` | Runs model turns through `codex exec` (Codex CLI) | OAuth login (`codex login`) | Uses your Codex/OpenAI subscription |
| `openrouter` | Direct HTTP API calls to any model | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Pay-per-token via OpenRouter |
| `deepseek` | Direct HTTP API calls | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | Pay-per-token via DeepSeek |
| `minimax` | Direct HTTP API calls to MiniMax's OpenAI-compatible API | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` | Uses your MiniMax Token Plan or pay-as-you-go key |

### Claude Provider (recommended)

Uses `claude -p` (Claude Code print mode) with your existing Claude subscription. No API key billing — runs on your OAuth login. Supports per-role model selection:

```json
{
  "llmProvider": "claude",
  "screeningModel": "opus",
  "managementModel": "haiku",
  "generalModel": "sonnet",
  "autoresearchModel": "opus"
}
```

Available model aliases: `opus` (Opus 4.6), `sonnet` (Sonnet 4.6), `haiku` (Haiku 4.5).

### Codex Provider

Uses `codex exec` with your OpenAI/Codex subscription. Same CLI harness pattern as Claude but with OpenAI models.

### OpenRouter Provider

Uses the OpenRouter API to access any model (minimax, qwen, etc.). Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`. Good for cheap models like `minimax/minimax-m2.7` or free models like `qwen/qwen3.6-plus:free`.

### MiniMax Provider

Uses MiniMax's OpenAI-compatible API directly at `https://api.minimax.io/v1`. This is the right option if you want to use a MiniMax Token Plan key directly instead of routing MiniMax through OpenRouter.

Typical models:

- `MiniMax-M2.7`
- `MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed`
- `MiniMax-M2.5`

All providers use the same ReAct loop with your custom tools — the provider only affects which LLM processes the prompts.

## Architecture

```
LLM provider -> ReAct loop -> tools -> Meteora / Helius / Jupiter / LP Agent
                  |             |
                  |             +-- wallet, pools, token info, deploy, close, swap
                  |
                  +-- Screener
                  +-- Manager
                  +-- General chat
                  +-- Autoresearch prompt optimizer
```

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- A Solana wallet private key in base58 format
- A Solana RPC URL, ideally Helius
- Codex CLI login if using `codex`
- LP Agent API key if you want LP overview / top LPer study
- Telegram bot token if you want Telegram control and notifications

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fciaf420/meridian.git
cd meridian
npm install
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
```

Nuggets (holographic memory) is bundled in `packages/nuggets/` — no separate repo needed.

### Provider Setup

Choose your provider:

**Claude (recommended — uses your Claude subscription):**
```bash
# Make sure claude CLI is installed and logged in
claude --version
```

**Codex (uses your OpenAI/Codex subscription):**
```bash
codex login
```

**OpenRouter (pay-per-token, any model):**
Add `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...` to `.env`

**MiniMax Token Plan (direct MiniMax access):**
Add `MINIMAX_API_KEY=...` to `.env`

Then run:

```bash
npm run setup
```

The setup wizard saves a starter `user-config.json`. It asks for:

- wallet and RPC
- risk preset
- deploy size and limits
- screening and management cadence
- provider selection
- a default model ID
- dry-run vs live mode

### First Dry Run

Before live trading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs the full bot with `DRY_RUN=true`. The agent still screens, manages, chats, updates the dashboard, and runs cron jobs, but real transactions are not broadcast.

When you are satisfied:

```bash
npm start
```

This is live mode.

## Operator Checklist

Before a real run, verify:

- `dryRun` in `user-config.json` is what you expect
- wallet key is set
- RPC URL works
- `llmProvider` is correct
- if using `codex`, `codex login` has already been done on this machine
- the dashboard loads
- the first screening and management cycles complete without errors
- Telegram is registered if you enabled it

## How Config Is Resolved

Meridian uses both `.env` and `user-config.json`.

Resolution order:

1. `.env` is loaded first.
2. `user-config.json` backfills key env values only when the env var is missing.
3. Runtime config is built from `user-config.json`, then env fallbacks, then code defaults.

In practice:

- `rpcUrl` can populate `RPC_URL`
- `walletKey` can populate `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `llmProvider` can populate `LLM_PROVIDER`
- `llmModel` can populate `LLM_MODEL`
- `dryRun` can populate `DRY_RUN`

Per-role model precedence:

1. `managementModel` / `screeningModel` / `generalModel`
2. `LLM_MODEL`
3. provider default

So `LLM_MODEL` is only a global fallback. The main live settings are the per-role model fields in `user-config.json`.

## Core Files

- `.env`: secrets and optional overrides
- `user-config.json`: primary runtime settings
- `user-config.example.json`: reference config shape
- `autoresearch.json`: prompt experiment state
- `lessons.json`: performance-derived lessons

## Environment Variables

Typical `.env`:

```env
LLM_PROVIDER=claude
RPC_URL=https://...helius-rpc.com
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_key
HELIUS_API_KEY=your_helius_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
MINIMAX_API_KEY=...
LPAGENT_API_KEY=key1,key2
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC...
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=
DRY_RUN=true
```

Notes:

- `LLM_PROVIDER` can be `claude`, `codex`, `openrouter`, `deepseek`, or `minimax`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is only needed when provider is `openrouter`
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is only needed when provider is `deepseek`
- `MINIMAX_API_KEY` is only needed when provider is `minimax`
- `claude` and `codex` providers use OAuth login, no API key needed
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` can be left empty; Meridian can register it automatically
- `DRY_RUN=true` is the safest default until you validate behavior

## Runtime Modes

### Interactive TTY

If you run Meridian in a normal terminal, it starts:

- the web server
- cron jobs
- the PnL watcher
- the REPL

On startup it may preload candidate pools. In that interactive flow:

- entering `1`, `2`, `3`, and so on deploys into the numbered startup candidate
- `go` starts autonomous mode without an immediate manual deploy

### Non-TTY

If Meridian is started without an interactive terminal, it still:

- starts the web server
- starts cron jobs
- starts the PnL watcher

It simply skips the REPL prompt.

### Startup Sequence

On launch Meridian typically:

1. loads env and config
2. initializes Nuggets memory
3. deduplicates lessons
4. restores any active autoresearch experiment
5. starts the web server
6. starts Telegram polling if configured
7. starts the PnL watcher
8. starts management and screening cron cycles

## Scheduler and Concurrency Rules

Meridian is intentionally conservative about overlapping work.

- management and screening cycles do not run on top of each other
- management can defer if another action is already in progress
- screening can skip if max positions are reached
- screening can skip if wallet balance is too low
- management can skip when there are no open positions
- the PnL watcher runs independently from the main cycles

If the bot looks idle, check logs for `skipped`, `deferred`, or balance / max-position guards before assuming it is broken.

## Commands

### REPL

Common commands:

- `1`, `2`, `3` ... deploy into numbered startup candidate
- `go` start autonomous mode without manual deploy
- `/status` show wallet and open positions
- `/candidates` show current top candidates
- `/briefing` show performance briefing
- `/thresholds` show screening thresholds
- `/learn` run pool study
- `/evolve` evolve screening thresholds
- `/stop` graceful shutdown
- `<wallet_address>` inspect another wallet
- free-form text chat with the general agent

### Web UI

The web UI exposes the same chat surface and a command palette.

### Telegram

Telegram supports the same command style once configured.

Important ownership rule:

- the first Telegram chat to message the bot becomes the registered owner
- that chat ID is persisted into `user-config.json`
- messages from other chats are ignored

Telegram can receive:

- deploy notifications
- close notifications
- out-of-range alerts
- PnL watcher auto-close alerts
- management cycle reports
- screening cycle reports
- daily briefing messages

## Web Dashboard

Default dashboard URL:

```text
http://localhost:3737
```

The dashboard is websocket-driven and live-updated. On connect it receives an initial payload, then refreshes wallet, positions, timers, candidates, and activity as the bot runs.

Main areas:

- status bar with timers and wallet state
- chat panel
- dashboard tab for wallet, LP overview, and positions
- candidates tab
- activity tab

If the dashboard does not load in normal bot mode, make sure the frontend was built:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

`npm run dev:web` is for frontend development only. It is not required for normal bot operation.

## Learning Systems

### Lessons

Every closed position can produce a structured lesson in `lessons.json`. Lessons are deduplicated and injected into prompts by role.

Prompt budget shape:

- pinned lessons up to 10
- role-matched lessons up to 15
- recent lessons fill the remaining budget up to 35 total

### Nuggets Memory

Nuggets provides persistent cross-session memory in `data/nuggets/`. Meridian uses multiple recall channels during management context building, including pool name, strategy plus bin step, strategy only, volatility bucket, and general lesson recall.

High-hit facts can be promoted into longer-lived memory context. The dashboard also exposes structured nugget stats so the memory system is inspectable, not opaque.

### Threshold Evolution

Meridian can evolve screening thresholds from real performance and lesson history. These changes persist back into `user-config.json`.

### Autoresearch

Autoresearch is prompt optimization driven by real closes.

It:

1. waits until there is enough close history
2. identifies the weakest prompt section
3. proposes one targeted prompt change
4. runs that change over later closes
5. keeps, reverts, or discards it based on trial performance

Current section targets:

- `screener_criteria`
- `manager_logic`
- `range_selection`

Important safeguards:

- it requires a minimum data gate before starting
- if the first 3 trial closes are all losses, it reverts early
- keep / revert uses a composite score based on win rate and average PnL
- kept overrides persist across restarts in `autoresearch.json`

Autoresearch is experimental. Results can be confounded if other adaptive systems, such as Darwinian weighting, also change behavior during the same evaluation window.

## LP Agent and External Data

Meridian uses:

- Meteora DLMM SDK for on-chain positions and transactions
- Meteora discovery / PnL endpoints for pool and position data
- Helius RPC for chain access
- Jupiter for token data and swaps
- LP Agent for overview, history, and top-LPer study

## Hive Mind

Hive Mind is optional collective intelligence.

What it can share:

- lessons
- deploy outcomes
- threshold tendencies
- pool and strategy consensus

What it should not share:

- wallet private keys
- raw wallet balances
- wallet addresses

Registration:

```bash
node -e "import('./hive-mind.js').then(m => m.register('https://meridian-hive-api-production.up.railway.app', 'YOUR_TOKEN'))"
```

This stores Hive Mind credentials in `user-config.json`.

## Troubleshooting

### "Wallet not configured"

Set either:

- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env`
- or `walletKey` in `user-config.json`

### Codex provider is selected but calls fail

Verify:

```bash
codex login
codex exec --model gpt-5.4 "Reply with OK"
```

If the direct CLI call fails, Meridian will fail too.

### Dashboard does not load

Build the frontend:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

### The bot looks idle

Check for:

- `dryRun`
- max-position guard
- low SOL balance
- deferred management or screening
- no open positions for management

### Telegram bot responds in one chat but not another

Only the first registered chat is accepted. Clear `telegramChatId` in `user-config.json` if you want to rebind ownership.
